================================
==  HOW TO RUN THIS SOFTWARE  ==
================================

This piece of software is provided as a fully working Eclipse project. In fact, it can simply be imported as an existing Eclipse project.
Please note that before the project will work you have to run the appropriate Gradle task which downloads and adds all needed third-party libraries
to the classpath. This should be done by using the following command:
  "./gradlew(.bat) eclipse"

Furthermore, Gradle provides a functionality to generate the Javadoc automatically
(it will throw some warnings but they can be ignored without any problems);
  "./gradlew(.bat) javadoc"

Lastly, it is also possible to build the project and create a distribution zip file which will create the same zip file you can download
from http://icloud.niftyside.com or the appropriate Github repository:
  "./gradlew(.bat) build distZip"

Side-note: it is always recommended to run "./gradlew(.bat) clean" or add the "clean" task to any other command to clean all old compiled files.


=========================
==  PROJECT STRUCTURE  ==
=========================

All Java source files are located in the soure folder "src/main/java".

To achieve a working Gradle build it is also required to add all used resources (e.g. images) into the source folder "src/main/resources"
according to the package structure of the main Java source folder. This means that resources are now located in two different source folders
whereas they are needed in the main source folder to be able to run the project under Eclipse and the resources located in the resources folder
are required to achieve a working Gradle distribution zip file.

Moreover, if any JUnit test are added they will be located in the source folder "src/test/java".
